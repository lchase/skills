# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

The **`lchase` Claude Code marketplace** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), a small
package of independently-installable plugins:

1. **smart-review** (`plugins/smart-review/`) — the flagship. A code-review skill packaged
   for multiple coding harnesses from one shared core under
   `plugins/smart-review/skills/smart-review/`. Each harness gets a thin manifest pointing at
   that same directory — no skill content is copied or forked. Claude Code additionally gets
   slash commands and native parallel-subagent `max`; other harnesses run the same workflow
   with `max` degraded to a sequential ensemble. The non-Claude entry points
   (`AGENTS.md`, `gemini-extension.json` + `GEMINI.md`) stay at the **repo root** because
   those conventions are root-scoped; the Cursor and Codex manifests live inside
   `plugins/smart-review/`.

2. **tldraw** (`plugins/tldraw/`) — Claude Code only, unrelated to smart-review. The
   `/tldraw:diagram` skill turns a natural-language diagram description into an editable
   `.tldr` document plus a rendered PNG/SVG. `plugins/tldraw/skills/diagram/` holds SKILL.md,
   `scripts/build-tldr.mjs` (spec → `.tldr`, then shells out to `@kitschpatrol/tldraw-cli`
   for images), and `references/tldr-format.md`. Its own version in
   `plugins/tldraw/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, independent of smart-review.

There is no application build. smart-review is markdown plus a small TypeScript eval
harness; tldraw is markdown plus one Node script. **Most of this file is about smart-review.**

## Commands

Validate before pushing (no CI configured — do this manually):

```bash
claude plugin validate .                                 # marketplace + both plugins
./plugins/smart-review/scripts/validate-adapters.sh       # smart-review manifests: JSON, version match, resolvable paths, agent↔lens sync
```

Bump smart-review's version across all its manifests at once (does not touch tldraw):

```bash
./plugins/smart-review/scripts/bump-version.sh 0.5.0
```

The tldraw plugin versions independently — edit `plugins/tldraw/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
by hand.

Eval harness (`plugins/smart-review/evals/`, Node 18+, dev-only — excluded from the packaged plugin):

```bash
cd plugins/smart-review/evals && npm install
npm run list                        # print corpus manifest, no scoring
npm run score                       # recall/precision, overall + per-case + per-lens
npm run score -- --drop security    # ablation: recall with one lens removed
npm run score -- --window 8         # widen line-match tolerance (default 5)
```

There is no automated "run the reviewer" step — producing `corpus/<case>/actual.json` (the
input to `npm run score`) means actually invoking the `smart-review` skill on that case's
`after.ts`/`meta.json` inside a harness and saving its findings JSON. `score.ts` reads
`corpus/<case>/{meta,expected,actual}.json` and matches findings on `(category, file, line±window)`.

## Architecture: smart-review

The design principle: **the merge is the product, not the lenses.** Six reviewers each
checking one thing beats one reviewer checking six things (attention dilution), and one
model reviewing alone repeats its own blind spots. Everything here exists to get ensemble
recall without ensemble noise.

Modes, routed by `SKILL.md`:
- **`min`** — one context, all six lenses walked in sequence, no fan-out. Fast path for
  small/low-risk diffs. The 90% case.
- **`max`** — spec-gate first (stop early if the diff implements the wrong thing), then the
  ensemble per `references/ensemble.md`: **isolated parallel subagents** where the harness
  supports them (Claude Code dispatches `agents/*-reviewer.md`), otherwise a disciplined
  **sequential lens walk**. Then the merge into one verdict.
- **auto** (plain `/smart-review` or the skill auto-triggering) — routes to min or max by
  diff size (>~150 lines or >~5 files), sensitive paths (auth, crypto, SQL, shell/file
  exec, payments, PII), or an explicit pre-merge/thorough ask.
- **`/smart-review:pr <PR>`** (Claude Code) — fetches a PR diff via `gh`, runs min/max, then
  gates on explicit user confirmation of what to publish before posting comments. Never
  approves/requests-changes/merges.
- **`/smart-review:pr-comments <PR>`** (Claude Code) — triages a PR's *existing* unresolved
  review comments via GraphQL, classifies each fix/docs/explain/disagree, gates on approval
  before editing and before pushing, then replies and resolves each thread. Not a review pass.

Key structural pieces, all under `skills/smart-review/references/`:
- **Lenses are fixed** — spec-conformance, correctness, security, performance, design, tests.
  Don't add a seventh lens for a new domain.
- **Domain depth rides in as checklists** (`domain/*.md`), injected into whichever lens
  applies per `checklist-routing.md`. Extending coverage means a new checklist + a routing
  row, not a new reviewer — this keeps `max`'s cost (5 parallel reviewers) fixed as coverage grows.
- **`finding-schema.md`** — the one shape every lens must emit
  (`{file, line_start, line_end, lens, category, severity, title, why, proposed_move, confidence}`).
  The merge operates mechanically on these fields.
- **`merge-contract.md`** — dedup by `(category, file, line-overlap-within-3)`,
  agreement-weighting (≥2 lenses agree → confidence + rank bump), conflict resolution
  (surface both sides), severity rollup to a verdict, hard nit cap (~5 P3s shown).
- **`ensemble.md`** — the max fan-out protocol and the harness capability check that picks
  isolated-parallel vs sequential.
- **`agents/*-reviewer.md`** (Claude Code) are the isolated-variant subagents, registered
  read-only. Each receives *only* the diff, spec, and its lens (+ routed domain) checklist —
  never the author's session or other reviewers' output; that isolation decorrelates their
  errors. `merge-synthesizer` is the only stage that sees everything. Cross-model routing
  (per-agent frontmatter `model:`) is the highest-leverage lever for catching more distinct
  issues. **Each reviewer agent is a Claude Code packaging of a `references/lenses/*.md`
  checklist — keep the two in sync;** `validate-adapters.sh` checks the reference link exists.

Because subagents cannot spawn subagents, the **top-level agent is always the orchestrator**
in `max` — there is no "lead reviewer" subagent doing the fan-out.

## Working on this repo

Paths below are relative to `plugins/smart-review/` unless noted. The tldraw plugin is
fully self-contained under `plugins/tldraw/` — its SKILL.md and `references/tldr-format.md`
are the source of truth (the `.tldr` format constraints there — id charset, fractional
index keys, `geo` enum — were hard-won; keep them). Test a tldraw change by running
`scripts/build-tldr.mjs` on a spec and opening the `.tldr`.

- A change to a lens checklist, the finding schema, the merge contract, or the ensemble
  protocol affects **every mode and every harness** (`min` and the sequential `max` inline
  the same references; the Claude Code reviewer agents mirror the lens files). After editing
  a shared reference, check `SKILL.md`'s workflow and the matching `agents/*-reviewer.md`
  both still make sense.
- Adding harness support = a new manifest pointing at `./skills/` + (if the harness lacks
  description-triggering) a hooks wrapper. Never fork skill content.
- Bump the version with `scripts/bump-version.sh` so all smart-review manifests stay in
  lockstep (it does not touch the tldraw plugin).
- Eval corpus cases (`evals/corpus/<n>-<lens>-<defect>/`): the `category` in
  `expected.json` must match the vocabulary fixed by `finding-schema.md` — scoring matches
  on it exactly.
